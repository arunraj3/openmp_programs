# Open Mp and MPI programs<br/>

<br/>
1. Given a nxn matrix A and a vector x of length n, their product y=Aâ‹…x. Write a program to
implement the multiplication using OpenMP PARALLEL directive 
<br/>
<br/>
2. Consider a Scenario where a person visits a supermarket for shopping. He purchases various items
in different sections such as clothing, gaming, grocery, stationary. Write an open MP program to
process his bill parallelly in each section and display the final amount to be paid. (sum of elements
parallelly)
<br/>
<br/>
3. Consider a Person named X on the earth, to find his accurate position on the globe we require the
value of Pi. Write a program to compute the value of pi function by Numerical Integration using
OpenMP PARALLEL section.
<br/>
<br/>
4. Using OpenMP, Design and develop a multi-threaded program to generate and print Fibonacci
Series. One thread must generate the numbers up to the specified limit and another thread must
print them. Ensure proper synchronization.
<br/>
<br/>
5. University awards gold medals to the student who has scored highest CGPA. Write a program to
find the student with highest CGPA in a list of numbers using OpenMP.
<br/>
<br/>
6. Design open MP program to multiply 2 square matrices and analyse the performance for the
matrix dimension of 1000, 2000 and 3000.
<br/>
<br/>
7. Assume you have n robots which pick mangoes in a farm. Write a program to calculate the total
number of mangoes picked by n robots parallelly using MPI.
<br/>
<br/>
8. Design a program that implements application of MPI Collective Communications.
<br/>
<br/>
9. Implement Cartesian Virtual Topology in MPI.
<br/>
<br/>
10. Design a MPI program to simulate the uses blocking send/receive routines and nonblocking
send/receive routines
